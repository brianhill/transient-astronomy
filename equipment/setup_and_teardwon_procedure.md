## Setup and Teardown Procedure

*An outline of the essential steps for preparing for an observing run and mopping up afterwards*

### Before Going Up

* Assemble keys, headlamps, and the laptop that will control the equipment

### Setup

#### After Arrival

* Unlock the control room
* Unlock the dome
* Put the south shutter down
* Set up small ladder stored in the control room outside the dome
* Clip dome doorway closed from inside
* Put the north shutter down

#### Uncover the Telescope

* Remove patio chair cover (there is a drawstring that has to be untied and loosened and there is a plastic snap buckle that has to be unbuckled)
* Remove sheet
* Remove plastic bag
* Remove three shrouds from telescope
* Remove metal covers over primary mirror (use extreme care &mdash; nothing stops the metal covers from falling into the primary)

#### Power Up and Connect to TheSky Fusion

* Activate Jackery that provides dome power
* Connect laptop to TheSky Fusion local wifi
* Connect laptop to TheSky Fusion desktop using VNC

#### Connect TheSky Fusion to the Mount and Home the Mount

* In the Telescope tab, under Start Up, hit "Connect Telescope" (this actually connects to the mount)
* Telescope will warn that it is not homed &mdash; home telescope

#### Connect TheSkyFusion to the Imaging Train

* In the Camera tab, connect to camera
* The preceding step should also cause the filter wheel, the autoguider, and the focuser to connect

#### Check Pointing and Focus

* In the Find tab's "Search for:" field, type in an easy target (such as Alcyone, the brightest of the Pleiades)
* After checking that target's altitude is positive (above horizon), slew telescope to target 
* Within the Camera tab is a Focus tab &mdash; use @Focus3 to achieve focus &mdash; sanity-check by repeating

#### Obtain Lights

*The planning and execution of the scientific part of an observation run is outside the scope of this document.*

### Teardown

#### Park the Mount and Disconnect TheSky Fusion from the Mount

* In the Telescope tab, under the Shut Down dropdown list, hit "Park"
* In the same list, hit "Disconnect Telescope"

#### Obtain Flats, Biases, and Darks

*The planning and execution of the scientific part of an observation run is outside the scope of this document.*

#### Disconnect the TheSky Fusion from the Imaging Train

* In the Camera tab, hit "Disconnect"
* The preceding step should also cause the filter wheel, the autoguider, and the focuser to disconnect

#### Power-Down Sequence for TheSky Fusion

* Quit TheSkyX app running on the TheSky Fusion
* Wirelessly copy images from TheSky Fusion to laptop (alternatively, images can be copied onto a USB stick)
* Use menu item on TheSkyFusion desktop screen to power down TheSkyFusion (you will know TheSky Fusion has powered down when you lose its wifi)
* Deactivate the Jackery that provides dome power

#### Cover the Telescope

* Replace metal covers over primary mirror (again with extreme care)
* Replace three shrouds (over secondary mirror, over trusses, and over the front of the telescope)
* Replace plastic bag (using masking tape to close off avenues for dust)
* Replace sheet
* Replace patio chair cover &mdash; handle goes to south and drawstring goest to north
* Tighten drawstring and tie it to the counterweight shaft
* Buckle the patio chair cover's snap buckle

#### Prepare for Departure

* Put the north shutter up
* Unclip the dome doorway from inside
* Put exterior small ladder away in control room
* Put south shutter up
* Padlock the dome
* Log any problems or recommendations
* Sweep grit out of control room
* Lock the control room, including any windows that were opened
