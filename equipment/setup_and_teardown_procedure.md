## Setup and Teardown Procedure

*An outline of the essential steps for preparing for an observing run and mopping up afterwards*

### Before Going Up

* Remembers keys &mdash; bring laptop that will control the telescope &mdash; remember laptop power adaptor

### Setting Up

#### After Arrival

* Unlock the control room
* Unlock the dome
* Put the south shutter down
* Set up small ladder stored in the control room outside the dome
* Clip dome doorway closed from inside
* Put the north shutter down
* Due to excessive friction in north shutter, it needs help descending to its final position &mdash; make sure final position is such that there is no finger pinch hazard 

#### Uncovering the Telescope

* Remove bungie and large plastic bag covering telescope and mount
* Remove three fabric shrouds from telescope
* Remove metal covers over primary mirror (use extreme care &mdash; nothing stops the metal covers from falling into the primary)

#### Powering Up and Connecting to TheSky Fusion

* Activate Jackery that provides dome power
* Connect laptop to TheSky Fusion local wifi
* Connect laptop to TheSky Fusion desktop using VNC

#### Connecting TheSky Fusion to the Mount and Homing the Mount

* In the Telescope tab, under Start Up, hit "Connect Telescope" (this actually connects to the mount)
* Mount will warn that it is not homed &mdash; home mount

#### Connecting TheSky Fusion to the Imaging Train

* Once the mount is quiescent, in the Camera tab, connect to camera
* The preceding step should also cause the filter wheel, the autoguider, and the focuser to connect &mdash; the filter wheel has sometimes gotten into a bad state during connection &mdash; power cycling the filter wheel by connecting and removing its USB cable remedied this

#### Checking Pointing and Focus

* In the Find tab's "Search for:" field, type in an easy target
* After checking that target's altitude is positive (above horizon), slew telescope to target 
* Within the Camera tab is a Focus tab &mdash; use @Focus3 to achieve focus

#### Obtaining Lights

*The planning and execution of the scientific part of an observation run is outside the scope of this document.*

### Tearing Down

#### Parking the Mount and Disconnecting TheSky Fusion from the Mount

* In the Telescope tab, under the Shut Down dropdown list, click "Park"
* In the same list, once parking has completed, click "Disconnect Telescope"

#### Obtaining Flats, Biases, and Darks

*The planning and execution of the scientific part of an observation run is outside the scope of this document.*

#### Disconnecting the TheSky Fusion from the Imaging Train

* In the Camera tab, click "Disconnect"
* The preceding step should also cause the filter wheel, the autoguider, and the focuser to disconnect

#### Powering Down TheSky Fusion

* Quit (using the &ldquo;Exit&rdquo; menu item) TheSkyX app running on the TheSky Fusion
* Wirelessly copy images from TheSky Fusion to laptop (alternatively, images can be copied onto a USB stick)
* Use menu item on TheSky Fusion desktop screen to power down TheSky Fusion (you will know TheSky Fusion has powered down when you lose its wifi)
* Wait another 15 seconds and then deactivate the Jackery that provides dome power

#### Covering the Telescope

* Replace metal covers over primary mirror (again with extreme care)
* Replace three shrouds (over secondary mirror, over trusses, and over the front of the telescope)
* Replace plastic bag and encircle it at a low point with bungee to close off avenues for blowing dust

#### Preparing for Departure

* Put the north shutter up
* Unclip the dome doorway from inside
* Put exterior small ladder away in control room
* Put south shutter up
* Padlock the dome
* Log any problems or recommendations
* Sweep grit out of control room
* Lock the control room, including any windows that were opened
