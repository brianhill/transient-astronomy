### Observation Notes

2022-10-2425: Sofia, Brian, Luke

10:40pm Started 15 60-second exposures 4x4 binning 

Temperature was 8.8&deg;. Our best possible focus was 6850, based on two runs of @Focus3.

Weather: Clear and cool and calm by 10:30pm.

New Moon.

On a third and fourth try of refocusing, @Focus3 brought us to 6498 and 6589. There seems to be significant interference from the atmosphere, making it difficult to get a consistent focus.

11:05pm Altitude of the object at 11:00 pm is 80&deg;, 41', 37'. 15 more 50-second exposures.

11:27pm 60 one-second exposure flat fields taken

11:43pm 10 sixty-second darks taken

11:57pm 60 one-second biases taken

This night we only took half and hour of total exposure time. The images looked clearer than the first night of observing. The target was at a higher altitude and the temperature was cooler
