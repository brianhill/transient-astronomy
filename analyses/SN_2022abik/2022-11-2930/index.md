## SN 2022abik 2022-11-2930

Moon is pretty bright (somewhat less than half full), and to east of target

Decided to do 30 60-second exposures each in g', r', and i'

At 9:40pm (beginning of the g' series) target is 30&deg; above horizon

At 10:22pm (middle of the r' series), target is 20&deg; above horizon

At 11:10pm (end of the i' series), target is 12&deg; above horizon and there is a thin cloud in that direction

I was toggling back and forth between apps and TheSkyX crashed. The last 2 to 3 of the planned 30 i' images were not performed.

### Calibration Photos

The calibration photos are in 2022-11-3001.

The bias photos should be discarded in favor of the 1-second and 30-second darks. It turns out TheSkyX ignores the exposure time
set on bias photos and does some very rapid exposure. I would not have noticed this if I had not needed some 30-second
bias files.

The 30-second darks are needed because the i' flats required 30 seconds to get a reasonable value.
