### Observation Notes

At 3&deg; we expect @Focus3 to converge to about 6550.

In fact, at 5.5&deg; it converged to about 6950. FWHM with 2x2 binning was 3.4 pixels. We focused using g'.

30 60-second g' exposures followed by 30 60-second r' exposures.

We are noticing about 1 pixel jumpiness in RA according to the autoguider. DEC looks better. Autoguider graphs report 0.51 pixel RMS error in RA and 0.15 pixel RMS error in DEC.

Changed @Focus3 parameters to search a wider range and do three samples per focus position, and got a compelling readout at 6700.
