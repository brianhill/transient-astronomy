Challenges in photometry are to be expected because targets are generally superimposed directly on galaxies of comparable magnitude. We imagine four strategies from which the required artistry in photometry will emerge:
  
  1.  Ordinary PSF photometry
  2.  PSF photometry with a fitted gradient background
  3.  PSF photometry by subtracting PanSTARRS images of the host galaxies (scaled to the plate-scale of our telescope, and possibly convolved to model our seeing)
  4.  PSF photometry one to two months after the supernovae have achieved peak brightness, using our images of the essentially-bare galaxies as background
