## First Supernova

As our first target, we are choosing to take a single evening's data on one of the brightest supernova currently visible, [SN 2022vqz](https://www.rochesterastronomy.org/supernova.html#2022vqz) in the CGCG 501-026 galaxy, also known as PGC 2986.
This supernova was discovered nearly a month ago by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and was highlighted in the Astronomy Section of the Rochester Academy of Sciences in [their listing of bright supernovae](./https://www.rochesterastronomy.org/supernova.html)

The 2000.0 coordinates of the host galaxy are 00h 51m 06.1561s  +29&deg; 32&rsquo; 15.607&rdquo;

### Observation Notes

2022-10-2122: Brian, Luke

Breezy, stars are twinkly.

8:30pm Breezy, stars are twinkly.

Got auto-guider going.

Went to dimmer star field and took a longer exposure (10 seconds) in @Focus3, and the graphs were still noisy, but @Focus3 converged.

6423 @18.1&deg;

Took 15 60-second exposures with CBB.

6355 @17.7&deg;

Took 15 more 60-second exposures.

@Focus3: 6306 @17.6&deg;

11:00pm 10 sixty second darks

11:22pm 60 one second flats

11:32pm 60 one second biases

4x4 binning

#### Improvement over the course of the evening

Is this because the atmosphere became more stable or because the altitude increased to 77&deg; or both?
