### Term 3-4 Break

* 2022-12-30 &mdash; Updated TheSkyFusion to [the latest (2022-04-21) release](https://www.bisque.com/thesky-change-log/#TheSkyFusionChangeLog) from Software Bisque
* 2022-12-31 &mdash; Meet to plan (1) target selection and observing schedule, and (2) development of our second-generation analysis pipeline using our [SN 2022abik data](./targets/SN_2022abik/index.html)
* 2023-01-02 &mdash; Meet to work on median subtraction and log stretch routines
* 2023-01-05 &mdash; Meet to work on alignment and stacking routines

### Week 1 (Jan. 8-14)

* 2023-01-08 &mdash; Meet to work on getting plate-solving to work
* 2023-01-10 &mdash; Brief clearing between storms enough to target [SN 2023cf](./targets/SN_2023cf/index.html), but images very soft
* 2023-01-14 &mdash; Analyzed [SN 2023cf](./targets/SN_2023cf/index.html). Images too soft ("storm seeing") to show the target.

### Week 2 (Jan 15-21)

* 2023-01-15 &mdash; Meet

### Week 3 (Jan. 22-28)

### Week 4 (Jan 29-Feb. 4)

### Week 5 (Feb. 5-11)

### Week 6 (Feb. 12-18)

### Week 7 (Feb. 19-25)

## To-Do

*Various loose ends*

* Report crashes to Software Bisque if they persist after updating TheSkyFusion.
* Investigate Software Bisque's Super-Model and ProTrack software as an alternative to auto-guiding.
* Get TheSkyFusion onto the Observatory network.
* We need to understand why 3-5 m/s winds are able to buffet the scope so badly. Is there looseness in the imaging train that we can remove?
* We need to add an FOV indicator for the auto-guider. An issue was that there was nothing in the autoguider frame on 2023-01-10 bright enough to survive the poor seeing and buffeting perhaps jogging the image would have corrected this.
