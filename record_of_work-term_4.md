### Term 3-4 Break

* 2022-12-30 &mdash; Updated TheSkyFusion to [the latest (2022-04-21) release](https://www.bisque.com/thesky-change-log/#TheSkyFusionChangeLog) from Software Bisque
* 2022-12-31 &mdash; Meet to plan (1) target selection and observing schedule, and (2) development of our second-generation analysis pipeline using our [SN 2022abik data](./targets/SN_2022abik/index.html)
* 2023-01-02 &mdash; Meet to work on median subtraction and log stretch routines
* 2023-01-05 &mdash; Meet to work on alignment and stacking routines

### Week 1 (Jan. 8-14)

* 2023-01-08 &mdash; Meet to work on getting plate-solving to work
* 2023-01-10 &mdash; Brief clearing between storms enough to target [SN 2023cf](./targets/SN_2023cf/index.html) &mdash; Tough (windy) night revealed more problems in our setup
* 2023-01-12 &mdash; Made final decisions on permanent pier height and ordered it
* 2023-01-14 &mdash; Analyzed [SN 2023cf](./targets/SN_2023cf/index.html). Images too soft ("storm seeing") to show the target

### Week 2 (Jan 15-21)

* 2023-01-15 &mdash; Got WCS plate-solving working and plate-solved files written (with caveats, e.g., MIDOBS)
* 2023-01-21 &mdash; A rapid introduction to object-oriented programming in Python
* 2023-01-20 &mdash; Observed Wolf-395 at Geoff's request &mdash; Added FOV indicator for auto-guider

### Week 3 (Jan. 22-28)

* 2023-01-22 &mdash; Got procedure from Software Bisque forums on debugging TheSky Imaging Edition
* 2023-01-23 &mdash; Made the calibration photos with Sofia and Andrew McCreary for Jan. 20 observing run
* 2023-01-27 &mdash; Rebuild setup with Luke in dome at 8&rdquo; lower height to reduce buffeting - moved it southward a few inches too - we still need to dust and rebuild the image train and then re-do the polar alignment
* 2023-01-27 &mdash; Set up college telescope behind duplex for observing Comet ZTF 2022/3

### Week 4 (Jan 29-Feb. 4)

* 2023-01-29 &mdash; Tear down college telescope &mdash; organize its accessory case
* 2023-01-31 &mdash; Create the directions for setting up the college telescope &mdash; this is a core part of the passover document

### Week 5 (Feb. 5-11)

* 2023-02-05 &mdash; Meet to get back to notebook development! Researching fitting methods (see [psf-fitting overview](./references/psf-fitting/overview.html))
* 2023-02-07 &mdash; Finished reassembly of image train
* 2023-02-08 &mdash; Finished recalibration (focus and sky model) following disassembly and reassembly &mdash; but discovered looseness in secondary position
* 2023-02-09 &mdash; Targeted [AT 2023bhc](.targets/AT_2023bhc/index.html) and tested write rate at one frame per second for 600 frames (full-frame binned 2x2) &mdash; tightening secondary put collimation out

### Week 6 (Feb. 12-18)

* 2023-02-16 &mdash; Crude recollimation (without needed adapter for Takahashi collimating scope) &mdash; Adapter located and ordered &mdash; Another recalibration (focus and sky model) following recollimation
* 2023-02-18 &mdash; Attempted AT\_2023buy, but failed due to too many thin clouds

### Week 7 (Feb. 19-24)

* 2023-02-19 &mdash; Attempted AT\_2023buy again, but failed due to mount disconnections
* 2023-02-22 &mdash; Ordered Windows laptop (may move entire operation to Windows)
* 2023-02-23 &mdash; Planned to re-cable USB connection between TheSkyFusion and the mount, but the mount disconnection problem would not reproduce

## To-Do

*Various loose ends*

* Investigate Software Bisque's Super-Model and ProTrack software as an alternative to auto-guiding.
