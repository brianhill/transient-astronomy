### Term 3-4 Break


## To-Do

*Various loose ends*

* Tests of our usages of astroalign
* Experimentation with better image-stretching routines
* Write a subtraction routine for removing the median value of a row
* Write (or learn to use the LogStretch routine astropy.visualization) so that a minimum and maximum ADU value can be specified (and maps to black and white, respectively)
