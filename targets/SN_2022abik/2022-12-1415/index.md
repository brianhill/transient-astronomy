### Observing Notes

A bit hazy or cloudy. Snow still on ground. 1.7&deg;C at outset of data-taking.

Another round 30 60-second exposures each in g', r', and i', this time, proceeding across series rather than doing all of g' first.

Began about 7:30pm at which point, the target was already down at about 40&deg;.

At 8:00pm the target is about 37&deg;.

At 9:00pm the target is about 25&deg;.

TheSkyX crashed *again* when approximately 80 of the planned 90 images had been taken.

### Calibration Photos

The calibration photos are in 2022-11-3001.

The bias photos should be discarded in favor of the 1-second and 30-second darks. It turns out TheSkyX ignores the exposure time
set on bias photos and does some very rapid exposure. I would not have noticed this if I had not needed some 30-second
bias files.

The 30-second darks are needed because the i' flats required 30 seconds to get a reasonable value.
