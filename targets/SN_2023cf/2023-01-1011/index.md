### Observing Notes

This was a promising clearing in a break between storms that was forecast by [ClearDarkSky](./AmazingCanadianForecast-1.png) and the [CMC](AmazingCanadianForecast-2.png). That said, although the forecast was correct, the wind was buffeting the scope and the seeing was terrible (something like 15 arcseconds).

One might say it was a waste of time, but it revealed weaknesses in what we are doing that we can now attempt to fix.

Due to the buffeting and poor seeing, observing did not actually begin until about 9pm.

Observing continued until just before moonrise (until 10:02pm). Times are local times (MST). 

### Learning

* The GFS, CMC, and ECMWF forecasts disagreed with one another on the extent of the clearing. Ultimately the Canadians were the most right of the three, but during the afternoon, it looked like the Americans and the Europeans were going to be more accurate.
* Interestingly, the moon did not rise over the local hills for 38 minutes after the rise time shown by SkySafari (9:29pm MST). That all by itself is an interesting fact when we are trying to squeeze observations in not many days after the full moon (4 days after in this case).
* We need to understand why 3-5 m/s winds are able to buffet the scope so badly. Is there looseness in the imaging train that we can remove?
* We need to add an FOV indicator for the auto-guider. An issue was that there was nothing in the autoguider frame bright enough to survive the poor seeing and buffeting perhaps jogging the image would have corrected this.
* I need have at hand TheSkyX name for the target so as not to waste time. In this case, UGC 3044 is most definitely not the same as PGC 3044. TheSkyX knows this target as PGC 15112, and it was only thanks to SkySafari that I was able to make the translation.

### Calibration Images

* Continue to use our existing calibration images, although we are going to need to re-do them once we disassemble the imaging train.
