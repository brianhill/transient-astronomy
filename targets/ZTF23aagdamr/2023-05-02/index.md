### Observing Notes

* Challenging Moon (88%) and wind (compensated by scissoring shutters)
* Clouds passing through at 1am disappeared on schedule
* Did 150 images (with the probability that quite a lot will have to be discarded due to wind and clouds, but actually they look good)
* Did 60 each of g and r as Moon was setting and Sun was moving into astronomical dawn, which looked like it was going to leave little room for good signal-to-noise, but on the plus side, object was nearing transit and signal-to-noise was ok (r looks kind of faint, g has clear signal)

### Calibration Images

### Analyses (notebooks open on github.com)
