## CurCom &mdash; Approval and Warning

Your DS was approved with the following warning attached: Oftentimes in collaborative projects, it becomes hard to discern the individual's work. During T6 in Ben Holtzman's class there was a similar assignment layout but it made it difficult for Ben to grade people on their own merits.

Take heed and bonne chance.
